people,People,33,people-1,1,Develop a common vision,2,Promote the shared vision.,Explain the three primary communication methods for vision promotion: push, pull, and interactive communication.,Push communication actively sends vision information to stakeholders through channels like presentations, emails, and status reports. It ensures consistent message delivery but provides limited feedback capability. Pull communication makes vision information available for stakeholders to access when needed through repositories, documentation, and websites. It serves stakeholder needs when they seek information but requires proactive access. Interactive communication facilitates two-way vision dialogue through meetings, workshops, and discussions, providing immediate feedback and clarification. Effective vision promotion blends all three methods—using push for vision announcements, pull for detailed information access, and interactive for alignment and engagement. Method selection depends on stakeholder needs, urgency, and complexity of vision elements being communicated.,Hybrid,Predictive,Communication,Stakeholder,foundational,[PMBOK 8th] Chapter 10.2,approved
