I am creating a comprehensive, document, and I want you to convert them into clean, well-structured Markdown that:
• Removes all page references
• Preserves accuracy while reorganizing for clarity
• Uses consistent headings, subheadings, tables, lists, and diagrams (ASCII or descriptions)
• Creates standalone content that flows naturally as part of a unified guide
• Never mentions that the content came from another source
• Avoids all bold text and emojis
• Maintains a professional, instructional tone matching a PMP study resource
• Converts imagery into textual descriptions or tables
• Enhances readability without adding new concepts

When I link the content, do the following:

1. Convert it into clean Markdown.
2. Add any tables, diagrams, or lists needed for clarity.
3. Maintain consistent format with previous sections.
4. Make it “book ready.”

Acknowledge when you're ready, and I will begin pasting sections.
